# Matkarajad

Matkarajad frontend repository.

## Running the frontend
For locally running the frontend, it is enough to just run the `npm run dev` command in terminal.
It will automatically connect to our backend that is running on the server, if there is no backend running on the local host.

## Building the frontend
For building our frontend just run the `npm run build`.

The built application will be under ***dist/*** directory.
